This is a 3-bit Gray-code counter with two clocks: up and down. 
The code is generated with a state machine. Next state is determined by the present state and input clk_up or clk_down (Meely FSM). 
The reset signal sets code as 000 and the next state as ch_01.

ch_01 : change 0 bit (1st)
ch_1  : change 1 bit
ch_02 : change 0 bit (2nd)
ch_2  : change 2 bit
